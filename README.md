## Shopify Bones

Shopify Bones is a base Shopify theme designed for creating themes from scratch. If you're looking for a stripped down liquid skeleton with lean semantic markup (including the customer area), this is it. No comments, no classes. Foundation 5 grid dropped in for convenience.

## Installing the Theme

1. Download the theme [here](https://github.com/jdlich/shopify-bones/archive/master.zip)
2. Upload the zip file to your Shopify store
